# Format for levels
# First line is level name
# Second line is starting location of players
# Next lines are enemies with format (location, time_created, speed, which car)
# Double spaces separate each level
# Hashtag is ignored
# END means end of game -> the player wins
# Level name = FINISH means there is no level anymore
# Level format idea
# Level has certain number of waves
# Level 1 only has one wave
# Each wave stays around 15 seconds
# There are also types of challenge
# Each wave could consist of multiple challenges
# Challenge type:
# 1. Double collision, where two pair of cars collide symmetrically
# 2. Diagonal, where cars appear continuously and orderly from left to right or the inverse
# 3. Orderly collision, where multiple single pair of cars appear to collide orderly
# 4. Parade, where multiple cars try to protect a car in the middle
# 5. Tooth, where cars come from front and back simultaneously at zigzag
# 6. Trap triangle, where there is left decreasing diagonal from front and right increasing diagonal from back
# 7. Incomplete Diagonal, like diagonal but there is a hole at the last part
# 8. Incomplete Orderly Collision
# From easy to difficult
