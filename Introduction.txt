In the not-too-distant future, the
world had become reliant on autonomous
cars powered by advanced artificial
intelligence. These cars had transformed
transportation, making travel faster,
more efficient, and safer. However, as
with any new technology, there were
unforeseen consequences.

One day, a glitch in the AI software
caused thousands of autonomous cars
to malfunction simultaneously, resulting
in a catastrophic chain reaction. Cars
swerved uncontrollably, collided with
each other, and careened off roads,
causing widespread destruction and chaos.

You and your cheap manual car was trapped
in the chaos. Many important figures have
died and it is up to you to fix the chaos.
Survive and bring halt to the chaos!
